## A. Introduction

eSignatures make the life easier for everybody who regularly needs signed documents. Experience shows that less paper makes life easier. 

Here, we collect information for setting up your eSignature project and guidance, predominantly for companies, although others might find parts of the information useful. We do explain the terms used in the context of digital signatures and explain their difference – what, for example is an electronic signature in contrast to it? If you want that riddle solved, read on ;-)

This repository gives an overview both of material we, the Liquid Legal Institute’s eSignature project team, have created, as well as resources by others we find useful.
