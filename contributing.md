# Contribution Guidelines

## A. Joining the project

The project is open to be joined by every member of the Liquid Legal Institute. Irrespective of membership, we welcome external suggestions for improvements and exchange. Happy to exchange.

## B. Suggesting changes

There's two ways to suggest a change:

* If you suggest a change to a text/code file in the repository, you can create a pull request and directly suggest the edit thereby.
* For all other changes or if you do not have an GitHub account, you can drop us a line (see end of this file)

### 1. Pull requests

#### a. The pull request should have a useful title 

Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title are not informative enough. 
Write about what additions you've made and *why* do you think it is useful. 

#### b. Guidelines

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style)
- Use the following format: `[Relevant Link](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category
- **New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome**
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title

#### d. Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. 

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.

The pull request part of these contributing guidelines is based on [awesome's contributing guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).
